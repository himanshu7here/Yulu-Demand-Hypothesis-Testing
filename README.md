🚲 Yulu Demand Forecasting with Hypothesis Testing -

📌 Project Objective -
This case study investigates the key factors influencing the demand for Yulu's shared electric cycles. Through exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing, it aims to uncover insights about how season, weather, and working days affect ride demand, ultimately guiding strategic business decisions.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used -
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
Google Colab (for notebook execution)
Excel (for initial exploration)

🔍 Key Insights = 
🧑‍💼 Higher demand on working days suggests commuters use Yulu for office travel.
☀️ Summer and Fall seasons show the highest ride demand.
🌤️ Clear weather boosts usage; demand dips in rainy/foggy conditions.
🔄 Season and weather are statistically related, influencing rental trends.
📊 Sample Visuals in Report = 

Demand variation across seasons and weather types -- 
Boxplots and scatterplots for count vs multiple variables
Histograms for temperature, humidity, windspeed, and count
Statistical test summaries (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square)

💡 Business Recommendations = 
🗓️ Boost availability on weekdays to cater to office commuters.
🚴‍♂️ Increase fleet size before Summer/Fall to capture peak demand.
🌧️ Run weather-based offers (e.g., rain gear promos during monsoon).
💸 Use dynamic pricing — surge rates in high season, discounts in low demand.
🎯 Segmented marketing — working professionals vs. leisure riders.
🏙️ Optimize zones near metro stations, tech parks, and residential hubs.
🔍 Use demand patterns to improve long-term operations and fleet planning.
